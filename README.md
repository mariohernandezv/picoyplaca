We made a class called "Car", it has a function: "picoplaca", it receives the car plate number ("aaa1234"), a date ("YYYY-MM-DD"), and a time ("hh:mm:ss"). It calculates if the car plate will be in picoplaca restriction at a specific time. It returns true if the car plate will have a restriction or false if it won't.
